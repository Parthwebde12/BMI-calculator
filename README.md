BMI Calculator â€“ A JavaScript project that allows users to input their height and weight and calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI) dynamically. Built using DOM manipulation, it updates the result in real-time, provides feedback on weight category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese), and demonstrates practical use of events, functions, and object-oriented programming principles.
